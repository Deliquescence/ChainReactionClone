/**
 * A server instance of a game. Each game has a server.
 *
 * ~Connecting to server/making game (direct connect)~
 *
 * 1. Server creates new game for people to connect
 * - Whoever hosts it will set settings in the waiting screen
 *
 * 2. Client connects to specified server
 *
 * 3. Server sends current settings and client generates the waiting room GUI from them
 *
 * 4. settings can be changed by host, and everyone changes their name
 * - name changes are sent to server and forwarded to other clients
 * - Host has a waiting room GUI with settings, clients have a read-only version
 *
 * 5. Everyone (including host) has ready button, which locks settings
 * - sends flag to server to send to clients which will display graphically who is ready
 * - when everyone is ready, game starts
 *
 *
 * ~Typical turn after connected~
 *
 * 1. Client sends requested move (x,y on board) to server
 * 2. Server validate that they can do the move or calculate if it is RNG turn
 * 3. Server sends the move to all clients and they display
 * 4. Repeat
